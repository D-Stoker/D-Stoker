<p dir="auto">Job hunting for January 2025, working 9 to 5-ish, moonlighting as a web development engineer in training; currently learning HTML forms.</p>

<p dir="auto">As an aerospace maintenance tech, I currently overhaul helicopter floats and liferafts to ensure operable working conditions; with a manufacturing background in computer servers and industrial tractors, maintenance became a natural progression. I've also experienced tech as web developer in the early 2000s, done social media marketing circa 2016, attempted a digital project management bootcamp in 2019, currently engaging in a web development bootcamp to upskill & go all in on IT.</p>

<p>When not crafting code, I've got 2 kids & 6 cats & family to take care of.</p>
